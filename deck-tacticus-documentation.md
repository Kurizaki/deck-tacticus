‚òùÔ∏è All text sections marked with a ‚úçÔ∏è can be deleted once you have filled out the respective sections.

‚úçÔ∏è Your group name and last names

| Date  | Version | Summary                                                  |
| ----- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
|       | 0.0.1   | ‚úçÔ∏è Each time you work on the project, add a new row here and describe in *one* sentence what you accomplished. |
|       | ...     |                                                          |
|       | 1.0.0   |                                                          |

## 1 Inform

### 1.1 Your Project

‚úçÔ∏è Describe your project in a concise sentence.

### 1.2 User Stories

| US-‚Ññ | Priority       | Type  | Description                       |
| ---- | -------------- | ----  | --------------------------------- |
| 1    |                |       | As a ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, I want ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è so that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. |
| ...  |                |       |                                   |

‚úçÔ∏è Each User Story has an integer number (1, 2, 3, etc.), a priority (Must or Can?), and a type (Functional, Quality, Boundary). The User Story itself follows this format: *As a ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, I want ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è so that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è*.

### 1.3 Test Cases

| TC-‚Ññ | Initial State | Input  | Expected Output   |
| ---- | ------------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| 1.1  |               |        |                   |
| ...  |               |        |                   |

‚úçÔ∏è The number follows the format `N.m`, where `N` is the number of the User Story the test case covers, and `m` starts at `1` and increments upwards. Example: The third test case covering the second User Story would have the number `2.3`.

### 1.4 Diagrams

‚úçÔ∏è Here, you can include PAPs, Use Case diagrams, Gantt charts, or similar visual aids.

## 2 Plan

| AP-‚Ññ | Deadline | Responsible | Description      | Planned Time |
| ---- | -------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| 1.A  |          |             |                  |              |
| ...  |          |             |                  |              |

Total: 

‚úçÔ∏è The number follows the format `N.m`, where `N` is the number of the User Story the work package relates to, and `m` starts from `A` and continues alphabetically. Example: The third work package related to the second User Story would have the number `2.C`.

‚úçÔ∏è A work package should take approximately 45 minutes for one person. The total number of work packages should roughly correspond to: `Number of R-sessions` √ó `Number of group members` √ó `4`. For example, if three people are working on a project with two planned R-sessions, you should aim for `2` √ó `3` √ó `4` = `24` work packages. If you realize you don‚Äôt have enough work packages, think of additional "Can" User Stories for Section 1.2.

## 3 Decide

‚úçÔ∏è Document your decisions and assumptions regarding your User Stories and implementation here.

## 4 Implement

| AP-‚Ññ | Date  | Responsible | Planned Time | Actual Time |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| 1.A  |       |             |              |             |
| ...  |       |             |              |             |

‚úçÔ∏è Each time you complete a work package, record how long it actually took here.

## 5 Review

### 5.1 Test Log

| TC-‚Ññ | Date  | Result   | Tester |
| ---- | ----- | -------- | ------ |
| 1.1  |       |          |        |
| ...  |       |          |        |

‚úçÔ∏è Don‚Äôt forget to add a conclusion summarizing the test results.

### 5.2 Exploratory Testing

| BR-‚Ññ | Initial State | Input | Expected Output | Actual Output |
| ---- | ------------- | ----- | --------------- | ------------- |
| I    |               |       |                 |               |
| ...  |               |       |                 |               |

‚úçÔ∏è Use Roman numerals for your Bug Reports, i.e., I, II, III, IV, etc.
